# üöÄ Deployment Guide

This guide shows you how to deploy your project to various hosting platforms.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Build your project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Your built files are in the `dist/` folder:**
   - `index.html`
   - `dist/index.ts`
   - `dist/styles/main.scss`

## üåê Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free)

**Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Krystian124/strona-dla-ojca.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Pages"
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main

### Option 2: Netlify (Free & Easy)

**Step 1: Deploy via Netlify UI**
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign up
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set build command: `npm run build`
5. Set publish directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 4: Traditional Web Server

**Step 1: Upload Files**

**Step 2: Configure Server**
Make sure your server serves `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing).

---

## üîß Manual Deployment Steps

If you want to deploy manually:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload files to your server:**
   - Upload `index.html` to your web root
   - Upload the entire `dist/` folder to your web root

3. **Configure your web server** to serve static files

## üåç Custom Domain

All platforms above support custom domains:
- **GitHub Pages:** Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Custom domain
- **Netlify:** Domain settings ‚Üí Add custom domain
- **Vercel:** Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Add domain

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **Enable compression** on your server
2. **Set proper cache headers** for static assets
3. **Use a CDN** for better global performance
4. **Optimize images** if you add any

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **404 errors:** Make sure your server serves `index.html` for all routes
- **Missing styles:** Check that CSS file paths are correct
- **JavaScript errors:** Ensure all JS files are properly loaded

**Need Help?**
- Check the platform's documentation
- Look at the deployment logs
- Verify your build output in the `dist/` folder 

---

## **How to Fix**

### 1. **Check Your Import in `index.ts`**
Make sure you are importing with the correct extension:
```typescript
import { Component1 } from './components/Component1/Component1';
```
**Do NOT** include the `.ts` or `.js` extension in the import.

---

### 2. **Check Your Build Output**
After running:
```bash
npm run build
```
You should have this file:
```
dist/components/Component1/Component1.js
```
If it does **not** exist, your build is not working or your file/folder names are wrong.

---

### 3. **Check for Typos and Capitalization**
- Make sure the folder and file names are **exactly** `Component1` (with a capital C).
- File system is case-sensitive in some environments.

---

### 4. **Rebuild**
1. Delete the `dist` folder:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist
   ```
2. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

---

### 5. **Check Your `tsconfig.json`**
Make sure you have:
```json
"outDir": "./dist",
"rootDir": "./src"
```

---

### 6. **Check Your `index.html`**
Make sure you are loading the script like this:
```html
<script type="module" src="dist/index.js"></script>
```

---

## **Summary**
- The error is a 404: the browser can't find the compiled JS file for Component1.
- Check your import paths, build output, and rebuild your project.

---

**If you still have issues:**
- Show me the exact import line from your `src/index.ts`
- Show me the structure of your `dist/components/Component1/` folder after building (`ls dist/components/Component1/`)
- Copy any new error messages here

This will help me give you the exact fix!

To commit and push your code updates to GitHub, follow these steps in your terminal:

---

### 1. **Check the status of your changes**
```sh
git status
```
This will show you which files have been modified or added.

---

### 2. **Add the changed files to the staging area**
To add all changes:
```sh
git add .
```
Or, to add specific files:
```sh
git add path/to/your/file
```

---

### 3. **Commit your changes with a message**
```sh
git commit -m "Describe your update here, e.g. Refactor backend structure and add MySQL connection"
```

---

### 4. **Push your changes to GitHub**
```sh
git push
```
If you are on a branch other than `main`, you may need to specify it:
```sh
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**That‚Äôs it!**  
Your code will be updated on GitHub. If you need help with authentication or see any errors, let me know what they are and I‚Äôll help you resolve them!
